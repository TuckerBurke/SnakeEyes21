# SnakeEyes21
## About
Snake Eyes 21 is a modified version of black jack. The differing mechanic is that aces are always valued at 11. 
Because of this, opening a pair of aces (snake eyes) totals 22 and is therefore a bust. You can download the
.jar [here](SnakeEyes21/dist/SnakeEyes21.jar) if you would like to play.
## Documentation
I created this game using Java in 2015 for my Fundamentals of Computing II course at Onondaga Community College.
Initially coded in Notepad++, I ported the code to NetBeans to create a .jar file. That required a bit of learning,
such as utilization of .getResource and packages. Although this was created using fundamentals, I think the project came out rather nicely and will likely use it in future portfolios. The font used is called Card Characters Regular and can be found on most free font sites. I was unable to determine the original creator.
