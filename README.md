# SnakeEyes21
## About
Snake Eyes 21 is a modified version of black jack. The differing mechanic is that aces are always valued at 11. 
Because of this, opening a pair of aces (snake eyes) totals 22 and is therefore a bust. You can download the
.jar [here](SnakeEyes21/dist/SnakeEyes21.jar) if you would like to play.
## Documentation
I created this game using Java in 2015 for my Fundamentals of Computing II course at Onondaga Community College.
Initially coded in Notepad++, I ported the code to NetBeans to create a .jar file. That required a bit of learning,
such as utilization of .getResource and packages.
